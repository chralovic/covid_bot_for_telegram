# COVID-19 bot for Telegram

A chatbot made for [Infekcionka telegram channel](https://t.me/Infiekcionka). Choose the region and the bot will show you statistics (how many people are ill, recovered and dead). The Belarusian officials didn't provide actual information about the virus, so activists had to gather it by theirselves with help of independent medias. There are no API nor site for parsing such kind of information, because the Belarusian authorities prefer to pretend the virus doesn't exist.
